# EMAIL SMS SPAM DETECTOR

## OBJECTIVE :- 

* To create a machine learning model which will classify email/sms as spam or not spam.

## HANDS ON :- 

* This web app is deployed on Streamlit.

## DESCRIPTION :- 

### DATASET :- 

* Download the dataset for custom training.
* Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

### STEPS :- 

* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data/Text Preprocessing
* Model Development
* Model Improvement 
* Website Development
* Model Deployment

### PACKAGES :-

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Scikit Learn
* Nltk
* Pickle
* Streamlit

### MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS :-

* Logistic Regression
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Trees
* SVM
* Random Forest
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boost
* XgBoost 

### TOOLS :-

* Jupyter Notebook
* PyCharm

### IMPORTANT POINTS :-

* Data Analysis Report & ML Model Performance Report is provided in the Reports folder.
* **Nltk** library is used for text preprocessing like **tokenization, stemming, removal of stopwords.**
* For converting text into vectors, **Bag of Words, TF-IDF** techniques are used.
* **Accuracy** Score and **Precision Score** is calculated for all algorithms.
* Initially **GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB** is used for model trainig. 
* TF-IDF and MultinomialNB are given good results.
* Other model are trained and Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest have precision score 1.0.
* For accuracy imporvemet maximum feature are kept to 3000.
* Accuracy Score and Precision Score of Naive Bayes are the highest.
